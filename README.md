# tic-tac-toe-game
Have a go at the classic game for two!
A simple game of tic-tac-toe created using Javascript, HTML & CSS through a React framework. 
It has been created as part of my learning process. Alongside the code, I have included comments to explain the code, and this can be used for learning/referring to the basics of the languages.
